Well, seems like I'm finally getting around to building this out. Not sure if that's a good or bad thing, but whatever. 


### What is this ? 

This is a silly project i've been attempting to get off the ground for a number of years, 7ish years of f*cking off and doing nothing, in which we (read me) build out at least one replacement for "The Complete New Yorker"'s windows application. The eventual goal is to have a much larger implementation which can be used on more than windows machines. 

### Why?

Because.

### Seriously, we're going to do 4th wall breaking references? 

Yes, my blog, my rules. plus i love doing bits. 

### Ok, but why? 

- i've started this project a bunch of times and keep ignoring it rather than just doing something about it. 
- want to start in on reverse engineering old software
- want to read on my ipad a bit easier 
- cats
- want to build out a larger system, cause why not.
- the new yorker archive online is slow as h*ck
- it's either this or do nothing after work. 


### What are the overall goals ?

- Create a drop in replacement for the windows application 
- Create tools which allow for extraction of all assets from setup file
- Create tools which allow for extraction of data from djvu files for easier reading 
- Create a locally hosted simplified browser based app 
- Create larger version of application which is hosted in containers and provides a myriad of features.
