## What's in the box?

*The Complete New Yorker*, initially released in 2005, is compendium of New Yorker covering 80 years of issues spanning from 1925 through to publication in 2005. Over 4k issues are contained on 8 dvd's, all viewable through 2 glorious 32bit applications which only kinda work on modern systems. 

//TODO: Insert picture of opened box set here

## What do we get application wise: Windows Edition

Upon first allowing the autorun we are generaly,depending on how old of a system you are using or if you've previously installed , we are told that .net is out of date and we will need to install the runtime in order to be able to use our application.

This is mildly funny due to the fact that .net a minimum of .net framework 3.0 has been included / installed on windows since the vista era (circa 2007) and this application was compiled in mid 2005. 

<br/><br/><br/>
We are now greeted with the installer for .net framework 1.1, which matches with the filestamp of installer (2005-07-28) as .net 2.0 wasn't released until October of 2005.

Once we get that all done, we can finally get around to actually installing the application. This is nothing special to be honest, but even if the setup file is copied to an ssd, it's still slow as all hell.  Once that's done and we open our app, we're greeted with a glorious cover of issue number 1 page.
